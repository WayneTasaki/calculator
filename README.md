## What I learned
- I chose to create the calculator layout using Grid which to date is something I haven't used often so that was great practice.
- A lot of how I built the project was based off of variable mutation. While I've mutated variables before, I don't believe I've done it quite like this. For example "currentNum" and "previousNum" would be mutated several times in one function which would be nested inside another function that mutates them again. It sometimes took me a bit to keep it all straight, but I think it was necessary due to having to store their changing values.
- Keycodes! Adding the keyboard functionality was fun because I was able to play with different key values. I found a website https://keycode.info/table-of-all-keycodes that lists them all in a table so you don't have to console log the event object and sift through it.
